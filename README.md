This repository contains a detailed architecture diagram for a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline designed to streamline development workflows and ensure robust deployment practices. The diagram visualizes the end-to-end process from code push to deployment across different environments.

Key Features:

Trigger: The pipeline is initiated by a code push to the 'dev' branch, activating a webhook.

Build and Test: The source code is checked out, dependencies are installed, and the build is executed followed by SonarQube analysis for code quality checks.

Artifact Management: Successful builds generate artifacts that are archived and managed on a Nexus repository hosted on a on-premises server.

Deployment: Artifacts are deployed to both staging and development servers to ensure thorough testing and functionality verification.

Notifications: Integration with Google Chat for real-time notifications on build success or failure, enhancing team communication and response efficiency.

Flow Description:

Developer Commit: A developer commits to the 'dev' branch, which triggers the pipeline through a configured webhook.

Automated Tasks: The CI server processes the commit, performs builds, runs tests, and conducts static code analysis.

Artifact Storage: On successful build, the artifact (tagged with project name and build number) is stored in Nexus.

Deployment: The continuous deployment process deploys the build to multiple servers, ensuring that the changes can be tested in different environments.

Feedback Loop: Status of the build and deployment is sent back to the team via Google Chat, providing instant feedback on the pipeline's status.

This architecture aims to minimize manual errors, provide faster development cycles, and ensure high-quality software production. Check out the full pipeline flow in the diagram included in this repository.
